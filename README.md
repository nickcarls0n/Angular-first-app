# Angular Test App

![Angular app screen shoot](/src/assets/images/first-app-github.png?raw=true "Angular app screen shot")

This app displays a list of super heros. The heros can be add and removed from the list. When a hero from the list is clicked on the details of that hero are displayed. There is a running list of messages that displays fetched data, this list can be cleared by clicking the clear button.

## Why did I create this?

I have been seen a lot of calls for companies needing Angular developers. Building this project was an easy way for me to get familiar with this development platform. 

## Running the development server

Run `ng serve`, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the project. The app will not open automatically, but once open the app will reload with any changes to the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
